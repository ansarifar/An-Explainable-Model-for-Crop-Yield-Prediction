We collected weather, soil, management, and yield performance data from publicly available sources for all counties of three states
(Illinois, Indiana, Iowa) from 1990 to 2018.

- Weather data were collected from the Iowa Environmental Mesonet (https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu), which included four daily surface weather
  parameters at 1 km^2$spatial resolution: precipitation (Prcp, mm), solar radiation (Srad, MJ/m^2), maximum temperature
  (Tmax, C^\circ), and minimum temperature (Tmin, C^\circ). Weather data from January to March were excluded, and only
  weeks 13 (April) to 52 (December) data were used in the model.

- Soil data were acquired from the Gridded Soil Survey Geographic Database (https://gdg.sc.egov.usda.gov), which included ten parameters
  at 1 km^2 spatial resolution: dry bulk density (BDdry, g cm^-3), clay percentage (clay, %), soil pH (pH), drained
  upper limit (dul, mm.mm^{-1}), soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (ksat, mm/day), drained lower limit (ll, mm.mm^{-1}),
  organic matter (om, %), sand percentage (sand, %), and saturated volumetric water content (sat, mm.mm^{-1}). All of these
  ten parameters were available  at nine different depths of soil: 0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-30, 30-45, 45-60, 60-80, 80-100, and 100-120 cm.

- Management data were acquired from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov), which included acres
  planted at the county-level, the weekly cumulative percentage of planting process and harvested fields at the state-level.

- Yield performance data were also acquired from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov)
  which included observed average yield performance between 1980 and 2018 for corn and soybean for all 293 counties 
  of three states of the Corn Belt: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa.

We also estimated additional features using the weather and management data based on agronomic insight to help 
enhance the performance of the model. The following weather variables were calculated from the raw weather data 
and added to the dataset:


- Growing degree days (Gdd, C^{\circ}), which is max{0,mean(Tmax,Tmin)-10}, which is a largely used 
  by agronomists and faster to track crop development.
- Number of rainy days (Rdays), which defined as the number of days with rain above 5 mm and below 24 mm in a week.
- Number of extreme rainy days (Exrain), which is the number of days with rain above 24 mm in a week.
- Number of heat days (Hdays), which is the number of days with Tmax above 34 C^{\circ} in a week.
- Number of cold days (Codays), which is the number of days with Tmin below 5 C^{\circ} in a week.
- Number of cloudy days (Cldays), which is the number of days with solar radiation below 10 MJ/m^2 in a week.
- Heat units (Hunits), which are the summation of max{0, \text{Tmax}-34} of a week.


Due to the lack of publicly available genotype data, we extracted two new variables using additional data from the 
National Agricultural Statistics Service \cite{NASS} to account for genetic contributions of the crops: (1) trend of 
historical yields and (2) trend of population density for corn and pod count for soybean. These two variables were 
added to the management category to reflect the gene improvement \cite{duvick2005genetic}. The proposed predictive 
model is developed to deal with both genotype and environment information while in the case study, genotype does not exist.
