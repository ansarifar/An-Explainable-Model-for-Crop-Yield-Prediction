We designed a heuristic algorithm for this step by solving a modified version of an 
algorithm that was designed for detecting epistatic interactions "New algorithms for detecting multi-effect and multi-way epistatic interactions".

Among the set of robust features that were selected, we selected a set of spatially and temporally robust interactions.

We used this algorithm to get robust interactin by exploring new interactions (using forward and backward stepwise
selection) and cross validating their performance.

Such process continues iteratively until a set of robust interactions has been discovered that lead to good prediction accuracy on the
training data and generalizability on the validation data.
